After studying linguistics at the National I.I.Mechnikov University of Odesa in Ukraine and the University of Granada in Spain, Solopova specialized in natural language processing with a master's degree at the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle. This was followed by a visiting fellowship at the University of Potsdam in Manfred Stede's discourse processing lab. In 2020, Solopova began her PhD at Freie Universit√§t Berlin; she is now close to completing her degree. During her PhD, she worked in the Petrakip project on an application for student teachers with automated feedback on their reflective essays. Solopova has also authored a number of publications on social media moderation and analysis, on topics such as hate speech, propaganda, and shitstorm detection.

Solopova has received the Erasmus + Special Non-EU scholarship, the Campus France French Embassy Scholarship, and the Elsa von Neumann FU Berlin Scholarship.

She has worked for three years as a teaching assistant in the courses Ethics and Epistemology of AI, Software Development Projects, and Machine Learning at FU Berlin, and has given workshops and consultations on Large Language Models, especially for non-technical audiences.
